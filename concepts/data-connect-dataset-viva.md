# VivaInsightsDataset_Report_v1_[Viva Insights query name] dataset

## Description

Microsoft Viva Insights provides scope information and research-based behavioral insights into how an organization gets work done; for example, whether employees maintain work-life balance, how to protect employee well being, and the ways that hybrid work affects the employee experience.

## Scenarios

Scenarios are customizable, depending on what dataset you choose to export. Scenarios fall into the following two categories, including those addressed with:

- [Person queries](/viva/insights/advanced/analyst/person-query-overview); for example, using Viva Insights metrics to measure empowering decision-making (including collaboration time, meetings, etc.) across the organization or from various departments.
- [Meeting queries](/viva/insights/advanced/analyst/meeting-query); for example, using Viva Insights metrics to better understand the time employees spend in meetings, especially those with hundreds of hours of employee focus time.

## Questions

Questions are customizable, depending on what dataset you choose to export. Here are some examples:

-	Which departments have employees who are at risk of burnout?
-	How have email and chat communication changed after moving to work from home policies?
-	How are employees spending their meeting time?
-	How is internal time spent distributed by department?
-	How does seller time spent with customers impact sales?


## Joining with other datasets

-	This data set can be joined with any data set based on join keys that the analyst sets in Viva Insights, such as, departments, sellers, external collaborator IDs, and so on.
