# Viva Insights VivaInsightsDataset_Report_v1 dataset

## Description

-	Gain insights on top collaborators, meeting and focus hours, and other personal productivity metrics. Customers can also create custom and reserved attributes that can be uploaded by analysts.

## Scenarios

-	**People sensing:** Empowering decision-making with Viva Insights metrics (including collaboration time, meetings, etc.) across the organization or from various departments.
-	**Meeting efficiency:** Understanding meeting time spent, especially those with hundreds of hours of employee time.
-	**Organizational network analysis (ONA):** Measuring how people were communicating pre- and post-Covid, creating their own analysis and connecting it with a much broader set of data.
-	**Seller productivity:** Using customer relationship management (CRM) data with Viva Insights data to highlight important accounts and contacts.


## Questions

-	Which departments have employees who are at risk of burnout?
-	How have email and chat communication changed after moving to work from home policies?
-	How are employees spending their meeting time?
-	How is internal time spent distributed by department?
-	How does seller time spent with customers impact sales?
