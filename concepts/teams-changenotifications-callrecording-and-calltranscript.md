# Get change notifications for meeting transcripts and recordings using Microsoft Graph

Change notifications enable you to subscribe to changes to transcripts and recordings. You can get notified whenever a [transcript](/graph/api/resources/calltranscript) or a [recording](/graph/api/resources/callrecording) is available after an online meeting.

This article describes scenarios for the **transcript** and **recording** resources. For more details, see [Change notifications for Microsoft Teams resources](teams-change-notification-in-microsoft-teams-overview.md).

## Subscribe to transcripts available at the tenant level

To get change notifications for any transcript available for any online meeting in a tenant, subscribe to `communications/onlineMeetings/getAllTranscripts`. The notification for a transcript is sent only if the subscription happens before the transcription starts. This subscription is supported only for meetings scheduled on the calendar.

### Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to subscribe to `communications/onlineMeetings/getAllTranscripts`. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not supported.                              |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                              |
| Application                            | OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All            |

## Notifications without resource data

Notifications without resource data give you enough information to make GET calls to get the transcript or recording. Subscriptions for notifications without resource data don't require an encryption certificate (because actual resource data isn't sent over).

For notifications without resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a transcript available for an online meeting.

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "265009c7-312c-4594-981f-f620d31abdd3",
  "changeType": "created",
  "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>",
  "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
  "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2023-03-20T11:00:00.0000000-08:00",
  "resource": "communications/onlineMeetings('MSoxMjczYTAxNi0yMDFkLTRmOTUtODA4My0xYjdmOTliM2VkZWIqMCoqMTk6bWVldGluZ19PVE0yTURZellUa3ROalkyT1MwMFlXRmxMVGcyWm1RdE5XTXdaalF5WlRJMk9XVmlAdGhyZWFkLnYy')/transcripts('MSMjMCMjNTYyN2ZiZDctNjFlNS00NGNmLWE0ZTQtYTQ1ODJhYTdmNGQ3')",
  "resourceData": {
    "id": "MSMjMCMjNTYyN2ZiZDctNjFlNS00NGNmLWE0ZTQtYTQ1ODJhYTdmNGQ3",
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.callTranscript",
    "@odata.id": "communications/onlineMeetings('MSoxMjczYTAxNi0yMDFkLTRmOTUtODA4My0xYjdmOTliM2VkZWIqMCoqMTk6bWVldGluZ19PVE0yTURZellUa3ROalkyT1MwMFlXRmxMVGcyWm1RdE5XTXdaalF5WlRJMk9XVmlAdGhyZWFkLnYy')/transcripts('MSMjMCMjNTYyN2ZiZDctNjFlNS00NGNmLWE0ZTQtYTQ1ODJhYTdmNGQ3')"
  }
}
```

The **resource** and **@odata.id** properties can be used to make calls to Microsoft Graph to get the transcript or recording.

For notifications without resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a recording available for an online meeting.

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "265009c7-312c-4594-981f-f620d31abdd3",
  "changeType": "created",
  "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>",
  "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
  "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2023-03-20T11:00:00.0000000-08:00",
  "resource": "communications/onlineMeetings('MSphZDJlYTFhOS0xNTdmLTQ3ZTItOTQ3ZS1iZmVkMWM5MDk3ZTQqMCoqMTk6bWVldGluZ19NR001T0dGbFpqQXROV1V5WkMwMFlqSTVMV0kyTkRBdE4ySXhaalEwTjJFeE1qRmhAdGhyZWFkLnYy')/recordings('ea1089e0-edf9-4044-9c6d-fc44dcaaf38e')",
  "resourceData": {
    "id": "ea1089e0-edf9-4044-9c6d-fc44dcaaf38e",
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.callRecording",
    "@odata.id": "communications/onlineMeetings('MSphZDJlYTFhOS0xNTdmLTQ3ZTItOTQ3ZS1iZmVkMWM5MDk3ZTQqMCoqMTk6bWVldGluZ19NR001T0dGbFpqQXROV1V5WkMwMFlqSTVMV0kyTkRBdE4ySXhaalEwTjJFeE1qRmhAdGhyZWFkLnYy')/recordings('ea1089e0-edf9-4044-9c6d-fc44dcaaf38e')"
  }
}
```
